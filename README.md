# Asynchronous Management in JavaScript

This repository is dedicated to the study and understanding of asynchronous behavior in JavaScript, covering everything from callbacks to the adoption of async/await, with a detailed look at the use of generators.

## About the Project

JavaScript is a powerful language that is widely used both in frontend and backend development. However, one of its main challenges is managing its asynchronous behavior. This project aims to help students and developers understand and manage this behavior efficiently.

## Covered Topics

- **Callbacks**: Understand the fundamental concept of callbacks and why they are used in JavaScript.
- **Promises**: Learn how promises enable better management of asynchronous operations, replacing traditional callbacks.
- **Async/Await**: Explore how async/await simplifies working with asynchronous code, making it more readable and easier to understand.
- **Generators**: See how generators can be used to implement async/await functions, providing a deep understanding of their internal mechanics.
